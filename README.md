Neural Network Model for AlphabetSoupCharity
This project uses a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras to analyze and predict outcomes based on the AlphabetSoupCharity dataset.

Project Files
Neural-Network-Model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

AlphabetSoupCharity.h5: Saved trained model.

AlphabetSoupCharity.weights.h5: Weights of the trained model.

Workflow Overview
1. Preprocessing
Loaded and cleaned the charity donation data.

Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Built a neural network using Keras' Sequential API.

Used appropriate activation functions and loss metrics for binary classification.

Evaluated model performance and saved the best-performing model.

Requirements
